# Mage Fighter - Prince Floyd and the Witch's Cadence
This is the release of Mage Fighter: Prince Floyd and the Witch's Cadence, a game created for the Starman.net "Very Hot Winter Funfest".

The theme was "Very Hot Winter", but due to my reading comprehension failure, I interpreted the theme as "Witch's Cadence", so this is a game in which you play as a young prince who sets out on his quest to rescue his sister from the Shadow Coven of witches. Along the way, he must also find a means to defeat the queen of the witches, Wicked Anabella, and end her Witch's Cadence curse once and for all!

Controls are listed in the readme, but are as follows:

Spacebar - "A Button" ( Talk / Accept )

Shift - "B Button" ( Sprint / Decline )

Z Key - Open menu ( overworld )

X Key - Open status ( overworld )

Additional Keys

Control + M - Mute or unmute music.

Control + L - Turn off encounters for current room, resets in new area

Control + R - Reset game
